  <h4>About this Image</h4>
	<p>These boys, ages 10 to 12, work regularly at the canning factory. Lewis Hine quit his teaching job and went to work as a photographer for the National Child Labor Committee which documented children&rsquo;s working conditions outside the home. Hine also focused on collecting the children&rsquo;s stories. He spent August 1911 in sardine packing plants at Eastport and Lubec, Maine.</p>
