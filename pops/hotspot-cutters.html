			<p>This image shows 8-year old Clarence, and 9-year old Minnie at work. The children are paid by the &ldquo;piece.&rdquo; According to Lewis Hine, the children receive $.05 for filling the box on the low table with fish. In modern dollars that equals $1.25. Once they are finished, the children clean themselves and usually go to another job in the cannery.</p>
