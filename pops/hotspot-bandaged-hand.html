		<p>Eight-year-old Richard cut his finger processing sardines in Eastport. He told the photographer that he was &ldquo;very soon back to work, as it was the season.&rdquo; He was the youngest of 11 children in the family, but only one of six still living. According to the 1910 U.S. Census, Richard&rsquo;s 18 year-old brother worked in the cannery, but could not read or write. This raises the question if Richard or his 11 year-old brother were literate.</p>
