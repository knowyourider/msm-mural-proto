  <h4>About this Artifact</h4>
	<p>The Sardine industry began in Maine in response to European demand for herring, a trade that was interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War of 1871-72. By 1900, sixty-nine Maine canneries operated in Eastport, Lubec, and other areas Down East. According to the Maine Department of Labor report in 1906, it was &ldquo;very conservative&rdquo; to count about 100 children under 14 years old working in the Eastport processing plants.</p>
