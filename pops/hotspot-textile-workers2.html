			<p>Children&rsquo;s wage labor began in textile mills, spreading to shoe factories and others. Maine children first found industrial jobs outside the home in the textile industry. By 1820, Maine had nine cotton and woolen mills, employing thousands.  In 1832, an estimated 2/5 of all textile workers were under 16 in New England.</p>
