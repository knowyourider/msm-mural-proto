	<p>According to the U.S. Department of Labor, in 1928 the average age of newsboys was 12. In Portland, a boy had to be 10 to work without parental permission. While their hours werenâ€™t terribly long, they were less likely to attend school as regularly as their non-laboring peers. The greatest concern among reformers in cities was the boys' interaction with dangerous people in the street who might abuse them or expose the boys to vice. Most newsboys by this period came from stable homes with both parents present. This image is of a group of newsboys from Biddeford, Maine.</p>
