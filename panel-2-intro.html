			<p>Americans&rsquo; idea about childhood has changed over the last 300 years. In the 1700s, children were viewed as little adults. Except in the wealthiest families, as soon as children were able to walk and take instruction, they were put to work. As America industrialized, more workers left the farm and home workshops for centralized &ldquo;manufactories&rdquo; making child labor more visible.</p>

      <p>Beginning in the 1790s, children held specific responsibilities in America&rsquo;s factories. Children were valued for their small, quick hands. For instance, they worked as doffers, exchanging full spools of thread for empty ones in spinning mills. Children as young as five years old worked for a fraction of the wages of an adult and were less likely to strike for better conditions. Youth employment, important in training and enriching a child&rsquo;s well-being, is distinguished from child labor whose goal is to extract the most work for the least money.

      <p>Children working alongside adults was considered normal and necessary when families needed their children&rsquo;s income for survival. Â As the middle class expanded through the 1800s, however, the differences between the lives of children in working class families and their middle class counterparts became increasingly apparent. Reformers set to work to improve the lives of poor children.</p>
